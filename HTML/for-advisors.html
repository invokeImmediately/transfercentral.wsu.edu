<h3 id="process">Process of Creating and Maintaining Departmental Transfer Equivalencies</h2> 
<p>Request for non-UCORE departmental transfer credit are reviewed by the academic department offering similar coursework. Each college has an assigned <a href="/for-advisors/academic-program-contacts/">contact</a> to disseminate and review these transfer equivalency requests.</p>
<p>If a transfer course is determined to have a WSU equivalency, the academic department may notify the transfer credit evaluators at <a href="mailto:transfer@wsu.edu" target="_blank">transfer@wsu.edu</a>. The Transfer Credit Equivalency website will be updated to reflect the equivalency for future evaluation and updates to student Transfer Credit Reports can be made by request.</p>
<p><strong>Please note an updated equivalency will not automatically change a TCR.</strong> Details needed include transfer course name, number, institution, WSU equivalency, and date range, and for any TCR update requests please also include the student name and WSU ID number.</p>
<p>The Transfer Clearinghouse will work to identify and notify departments of transfer equivalencies with expired date ranges in need of review. Departments may also request that the ending date range be 12/31/9999 (no end date) if they continually monitor changes to either the WSU course or the transfer course.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="departmental-credit">Departmental Credit</h2> 
<p>Requests for departmental transfer credit should be sent to <a href="mailto:transfer@wsu.edu" target="_blank">transfer@wsu.edu</a> and are then reviewed by the academic department offering similar coursework, and each college or academic department has a <a href="/for-advisors/academic-program-contacts/">contact</a> to review these transfer equivalency requests. Departments may submit undergraduate departmental course equivalencies to <a href="mailto:transfer@wsu.edu" target="_blank">transfer@wsu.edu</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://zzusis-utilities.wsu.edu/psportal/pages/transfercoursesearch.html" target="_blank">Transfer Credit Equivalency website</a> will be updated to reflect the equivalency for department evaluations. Details needed to update the TCE website include transfer course name, number, institution, WSU equivalency, and date range. <em>Please note an updated equivalency will not automatically change a student’s Transfer Credit Report so a request must be made.</em> For any TCR updated requests please also include the student name and WSU ID number.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Transfer Clearinghouse will work to identify and notify departments of transfer equivalencies with expired date ranges in need of review. Departments may also request that the ending date range be 12/31/9999 (no end date) if they continually monitor changes to either the WSU course or the transfer course.</p>

<h3 id="transfer-gpas">Transfer GPAs</h2> 
<p>Grades received in transferable college-level courses are used in calculating an admissions transfer GPA and admissions transfer hours. Grades of “D” are transferable. The department may, however, require students to repeat “D” grades in the major field of study. Transfer GPAs are not averaged into the WSU GPA.</p>
<p>Grades of C-or lower will be disregarded if the course is repeated and another grade is earned. Grades of C or above will not be accepted if repeated for credit or for raising the GPA.  Earning transfer credit with a direct transfer equivalency removes the WSU grade of the course that was repeated from your GPA calculation. Please see <a href="http://catalog.wsu.edu/General/AcademicRegulations/ListBy/34" target="_blank">Academic Regulation 34</a> and the <a href="http://registrar.wsu.edu/grades-and-gpa/" target="_blank">Office of the Registrar’s Grade and GPA webpage</a> for more information.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="series-of-courses">Series of Courses</h2> 
<p>“One to one rules” are simple equivalencies which identify that one course is equivalent to the WSU course and the transfer GPA reflects each course individually. <em>Please note:</em> One course cannot have two equivalencies in MyWSU.</p>
<p>“Many to one rules” are used to combine two or more transfer courses as equivalent to one WSU course. In these cases the transfer grade for the WSU internal equivalent will reflect the grade the student earned in the second course.</p>
<p>“Many to many rules” are considered complex equivalencies and are used to define that two or more transfer courses are equivalent to two or more WSU courses.  This means that we must specify fixed units for each internal equivalent, and that the transfer grade is identified by an incoming course.  For example, if there are three incoming courses that equate to two WSU courses, the transfer grade for the WSU internal equivalent will reflect the grade the student earned in the second and third quarter of the three quarter series.  If the lab and lecture components are identified as separate course numbers, the transfer grade(s) used will be based on the lecture portion(s) of the course(s), not the lab component.</p>
<p><em>Please note:</em> It is highly recommended transfer students complete the full series of courses at a single transfer institution otherwise the courses may need to submitted to <a href="mailto:transfer@wsu.edu" target="_blank">transfer@wsu.edu</a> for additional review.</p>
