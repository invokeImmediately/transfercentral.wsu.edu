<p class="nrml"><img class="autoScaledTo90 shiftToCenter spaces-top-half spaces-btm-half" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/917/2016/08/photo_news_waylon-advising-at-transfer-resource-center_700x370.jpg" /><strong>PULLMAN, Wash.—</strong>Students with college credits earned outside Washington State University have a new place to find information on WSU’s Pullman campus. The WSU Transfer Clearinghouse has now opened the Transfer Resource Center (TRC), located mid-campus in room 403 of the Smith Center for Undergraduate Education (CUE).</p>
<p class="nrml">“Beyond the many services we provide, I want the students to view the Transfer Resource Center as the place for students to come, get answers, and get involved,” said Susan Poch, assistant vice provost and center director.</p>
<p class="nrml">The TRC now provides a centralized location for current and prospective students to access the services provided by the Transfer Clearinghouse, a unit within the WSU Office of Undergraduate Education. These services include assistance with the transfer credit evaluation process, pre-transfer advising, access to campus-based resources, and promotion of transfer-specific clubs and activities.</p>
<h4>WSU choice of transfer students</h4>
<p class="nrml">“Recent data shows that nearly 80 percent of WSU students, by the time they graduate, earned some type of transfer credit,” Poch said. They could have successfully completed classes or an associates or baccalaureate degrees at other institutions, or completed academic work in the military or taken Running Start and Advanced Placement courses in high school, for example.</p>
<p class="nrml">“That percentage represents a significant population of our students who have unique course credit and college transition needs for us to fill,” Poch said. “We want every one of them to have the best experience at our university from the time they apply for admission through their graduation.</p>
<p class="nrml">“Transfer students bring diversity and unique experiences to classrooms and our community, and we want WSU to be transfer students’ university of choice.”</p>
<p class="nrml">Assistant Director Waylon Safranski added, “We will do that through services provided directly to those students by the Transfer Clearinghouse, and through the results of our many collaborations with admissions counselors, academic advisors, and college liaisons at each WSU campus. It’s nice to now have the Transfer Resource Center as a place to call home.”</p>
<h4>Website, equivalency database, answer line, clubs</h4>
<p class="nrml">The Transfer Clearinghouse website <a href="https://transfercredit.wsu.edu">transfercredit.wsu.edu</a> provides thorough information on the transfer credit process, types of credit and how degrees transfer, evaluation request forms, details on WSU academic programs and graduation requirements, statewide transfer initiatives, and lists of WSU resources.</p>
<p class="nrml">The website also links to the transfer equivalency database, which provides vital information to students planning to transfer credits to WSU. Over the past year, the Transfer Clearinghouse has worked to update equivalencies for University Common Requirements (UCORE) and departmental courses, and progress is continuing on a new design layout along with eventual enhancements to show prospective students how transfer credit applies toward WSU degrees.</p>
<p class="nrml">The center’s two-part “Transfer Answerline” aims to provide rapid responses and guidance to transfer-related emails to <a href="mailto:transfer@wsu.edu" target="_blank">transfer@wsu.edu</a> and phone calls to 509-335-8704. Safranski is the point person, and also handles one-to-one meetings with students.</p>
<p class="nrml">Two registered student organizations just for transfer students – Team Transfer and Tau Sigma, an honorary – will hold their meetings in the CUE 403 suite. John Nugent, assistant director of New Student Programs, is the advisor to the groups.</p>
