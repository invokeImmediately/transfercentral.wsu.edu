    <dt><strong>Elective credit</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Courses that do not have a direct equivalency may transfer to WSU for elective credit, shown as Elective 1xx, Elective 3xx, MATH1xx, and ENGL3xx, etc. The appropriate departments and colleges determine the use of elective credit toward degree requirements.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>Departmental credit</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Courses may be reviewed for departmental credit at student request if the transfer course is not listed in the equivalency data base and the student believes it may be equivalent to a department requirement/course.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>Non-transferable credits</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Non-transferable credits (NON_T in the equivalency database) are credits that will not transfer to WSU. These credits may include but are not limited to: courses taken at colleges or universities that are not regionally accredited, non-credit courses and workshops, remedial or college preparatory courses, sectarian religious studies, vocational-technical courses</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>Lab Credit</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>If a WSU course has a lab component, the transfer course must also contain a lab component in order to be considered a direct equivalency.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>Transfer GPA</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Transfer GPA is calculated using grades received in transferable college-level courses.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>Semester Hours</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Quarter credits can be converted to Semester credits by multiplying quarter credit hours by 0.67. Using this equation, 5 quarter credits would convert to 3.35 semester credits.</p>

    <dd>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1XX, 2XX, etc.</strong> – This code will appear when courses taken at the transfer institution transfer to WSU but do not have a direct equivalency to a WSU course. Example: HIST 100 at the transfer institution may transfer to WSU as HISTORY 1XX. These courses may still satisfy UCORE requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>SUBJECT ###, 1##, 2##, etc.</strong> – These courses are taken at the transfer institution. Courses with this code may be non-transferable or they may transfer as an elective of the equal course level (Example: JAPN 1## taken at the transfer institution may transfer to WSU as JAPANESE 1XX)</li>
            <li><strong>NON_T</strong> – Non-transferable credits</li>
            <li><strong>SUBJECT& (example: HIST& 116)</strong> – Courses from the WA 45 list are guaranteed to meet general education requirements at any of the public 4 year institutions in Washington. Note: course numbers from the transfer institution will not always match WSU course numbers. Example: BIOL& 100 at a two-year institution may be equivalent to BIOLOGY 102 at the four-year institution.</li>

        <p>Any student who has attended college after the summer following high school graduation.</p>

    <dd>
        <p>College credit earned while still in high school. Although these students will have transfer credits, they are not considered transfer students.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>Direct Transfer Agreement (DTA) Associate’s Degree</strong></dt>
    <dd><p>An associate degree that incorporates general education requirements similar to WSU’s. For having earned this type of associate degree, a student will get credit for the WSU’s lower-division University Common Requirements (UCORE) and will generally be given junior standing.</p></dd>
    <dt><strong>“Reverse Transfer” Direct Transfer Agreement (DTA)</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Reverse transfer allows students to physically transfer from a two-year to a four-year institution before completing an associate degree; students may then earn credits at the four-year institution which may be transferred back to the two-year institution for completion of an associate’s degree.</p>

        <p><strong>“One to one rules”</strong> are simple equivalencies which identify that one course is equivalent to the WSU course and the transfer GPA reflects each course individually.  Please note: One course cannot have two equivalencies in MyWSU.</p>
        <p><strong>“Many to one rules”</strong> are used to combine two or more transfer courses as equivalent to one WSU course. In these cases the transfer grade for the WSU internal equivalent will reflect the grade the student earned in the second course.</p>
        <p><strong>“Many to many rules”</strong> are considered complex equivalencies and are used to define that two or more transfer courses are equivalent to two or more WSU courses.  This means that we must specify fixed units for each internal equivalent, and that the transfer grade is identified by an incoming course.  For example, if there are three incoming courses that equate to two WSU courses, the transfer grade for the WSU internal equivalent will reflect the grade the student earned in the second and third quarter of the three quarter series.  If the lab and lecture components are identified as separate course numbers, the transfer grade(s) used will be based on the lecture portion(s) of the course(s), not the lab component.</p>
