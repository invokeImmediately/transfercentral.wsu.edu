        <p>Courses that do not have a direct equivalency may transfer to WSU for elective credit. Courses which receive elective credit are shown on the <a href="/evaluation-transfer-credit/transfer-credit-equivalency-database/">Transfer Credit Equivalency Database</a> as <code>Elective 1xx</code>, <code>Elective 3xx</code>, <code>MATH1xx</code>, and <code>ENGL3xx</code>, etc. The appropriate departments and colleges determine the use of elective credit toward degree requirements.</p>

        <p>If a transfer course is not listed in the <a href="/evaluation-transfer-credit/transfer-credit-equivalency-database/">Transfer Credit Equivalency Database</a> and the student believes it may be equivalent to a department requirement/course, the course may be reviewed for departmental credit at student request.</p>

    <dd>
        <p>Non-transferable credits (<code>NON_T</code> in the <a href="/evaluation-transfer-credit/transfer-credit-equivalency-database/">equivalency database</a>) are credits that will not transfer to WSU. These credits may include but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Courses taken at colleges or universities that are not regionally accredited</li>
            <li>Non-credit courses and workshops</li>

    <dd>
        <p>Up to 15 quarter (10 semester) credits of coursework at the 100 level or above, which are otherwise non-transferable vocational/technical courses, may transfer as part of a DTA Associate degree meeting the ICRC guidelines. These credits are labeled as “gray area” and entered as <code>GRAY 999</code> into the database with a grade of <code>P</code>.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt id="lab-credit"><strong>Lab Credit</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Credit received by taking a course with a laboratory component. If a WSU course has a lab component, the transfer course must also contain a lab component in order to be considered a direct equivalency.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt id="transfer-gpa"><strong>Transfer GPA</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Transfer GPA is the transfer student's GPA as accepted and calculated by WSU. The transfer GPA is calculated using grades received in transferable college-level courses.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt id="semester-hours"><strong>Semester Hours</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>WSU is on a semester system and divides the academic year into two terms, fall and spring, plus a summer session. Quarter credit hours can be converted to semester credit hours by multiplying quarter credit hours by 0.67. Using this equation, 5 quarter credits would convert to 3.35 semester credits.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong><code>SUBJECT ###</code></strong> – This code may appear as <code>SUBJECT ###</code>, <code>1##</code>, <code>2##</code>, etc. These courses are taken at the transfer institution.

        <p><strong>“One to one rules”</strong> are simple equivalencies which identify that one course is equivalent to the WSU course and the transfer GPA reflects each course individually.  Please note: One course cannot have two equivalencies in MyWSU.</p>
        <p><strong>“Many to one rules”</strong> are used to combine two or more transfer courses as equivalent to one WSU course. In these cases the transfer grade for the WSU internal equivalent will reflect the grade the student earned in the second course.</p>
        <p><strong>“Many to many rules”</strong> are considered complex equivalencies and are used to define that two or more transfer courses are equivalent to two or more WSU courses.  This means that we must specify fixed units for each internal equivalent, and that the transfer grade is identified by an incoming course.  For example, if there are three incoming courses that equate to two WSU courses, the transfer grade for the WSU internal equivalent will reflect the grade the student earned in the second and third quarter of the three quarter series.  If the lab and lecture components are identified as separate course numbers, the transfer grade(s) used will be based on the lecture portion(s) of the course(s), not the lab component.</p>
