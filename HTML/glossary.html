</section><dl class="faq toggled"><dt id="ucore"><strong>UCORE</strong></dt><dd>
<p class="oue-normal">An acronym that stands for “University Common Requirements.” UCORE organizes courses into categories by subject, and to be able to graduate from WSU, each student must have taken the right amount and type of courses such that they have earned the required number of credits within each UCORE category.</p>
<p class="vpue-jump-back"><a href="#top">—Back to Top—</a></p>

</dd><dt id="elective-credit"><strong>Elective credit</strong></dt><dd>
<p class="oue-normal">Courses that do not have a direct equivalency may transfer to WSU for elective credit. Courses which receive elective credit are shown on the <a href="/evaluation-transfer-credit/transfer-credit-equivalency-database/">Transfer Credit Equivalency Database</a> as <code>Elective 1xx</code>, <code>Elective 3xx</code>, <code>MATH1xx</code>, and <code>ENGL3xx</code>, etc. The appropriate departments and colleges determine the use of elective credit toward degree requirements.</p>
<p class="vpue-jump-back"><a href="#top">—Back to Top—</a></p>

</dd><dt id="departmental-credit"><strong>Departmental credit</strong></dt><dd>
<p class="oue-normal">If a transfer course is not listed in the <a href="/evaluation-transfer-credit/transfer-credit-equivalency-database/">Transfer Credit Equivalency Database</a> and it may be equivalent to a department requirement/course, the course may be reviewed for departmental credit at student request.</p>
<p class="vpue-jump-back"><a href="#top">—Back to Top—</a></p>

</dd><dt id="non-transferable-credits"><strong>Non-transferable credits</strong></dt><dd>
<p class="oue-normal">Non-transferable credits (<code>NON_T</code> in the <a href="/evaluation-transfer-credit/transfer-credit-equivalency-database/">equivalency database</a>) are credits that will not transfer to WSU. These credits may include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Courses taken at colleges or universities that are not regionally accredited</li>
	<li>Non-credit courses and workshops</li>
	<li>Remedial or college preparatory courses</li>
	<li>Sectarian religious studies</li>
	<li>Vocational-technical courses.</li>
</ul>
<p class="vpue-jump-back"><a href="#top">—Back to Top—</a></p>

</dd><dt id="dt-gray-area-elective"><strong>DTA Gray Area Elective</strong></dt><dd>
<p class="oue-normal">Up to 15 quarter (10 semester) credits of coursework at the 100 level or above, which are otherwise non-transferable vocational/technical courses, may transfer as part of a DTA Associate degree meeting the ICRC guidelines. These credits are labeled as “gray area” and entered as <code>GRAY 999</code> into the database with a grade of <code>P</code>.</p>
<p class="vpue-jump-back"><a href="#top">—Back to Top—</a></p>

</dd><dt id="lab-credit"><strong>Lab Credit</strong></dt><dd>
<p class="oue-normal">Credit received by taking a course with a laboratory component. If a WSU course has a lab component, the transfer course must also contain a lab component in order to be considered a direct equivalency.</p>
<p class="vpue-jump-back"><a href="#top">—Back to Top—</a></p>

</dd><dt id="transfer-gpa"><strong>Transfer GPA</strong></dt><dd>
<p class="oue-normal">Transfer GPA is the transfer student's GPA as accepted and calculated by WSU. The transfer GPA is calculated using grades received in transferable college-level courses. The transfer GPA is not averaged into the WSU GPA.</p>
<p class="vpue-jump-back"><a href="#top">—Back to Top—</a></p>

</dd><dt id="semester-hours"><strong>Semester Hours</strong></dt><dd>
<p class="oue-normal">WSU is on a semester system and divides the academic year into two terms, fall and spring, plus a summer session. Quarter credit hours can be converted to semester credit hours by multiplying quarter credit hours by 0.67. Using this equation, 5 quarter credits would convert to 3.35 semester credits.</p>
<p class="vpue-jump-back"><a href="#top">—Back to Top—</a></p>

</dd><dt id="equivalency-database"><strong>Transfer Credit Equivalency Database</strong></dt><dd>
<p class="oue-normal">The Transfer Credit Equivalency Database provides information to assist students in planning for transfer of courses to WSU. Transfer courses are displayed when a direct equivalency at WSU exists, if a course is similar to a WSU University Common Requirement (UCORE), if the course is a department or general elective, or if the courses are non-transferable.</p>
<p class="vpue-jump-back"><a href="#top">—Back to Top—</a></p>

</ul>
<strong>Transfer course codes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong><code>SUBJECT ###</code></strong> – This code may appear as <code>SUBJECT ###</code>, <code>1##</code>, <code>2##</code>, etc. These courses are taken at the transfer institution. Courses with this code may be non-transferable, or they may transfer as an elective of the equal course level. (Example: <code>JAPN 1##</code> taken at the transfer institution may transfer to WSU as <code>JAPANESE 1XX</code>.)</li>
	<li><strong><code>SUBJECT&amp;</code></strong> – Courses with this designation are considered Common Course Numbers (CCN). They indicate that the content of these courses are similar throughout the Washington community college system.</li>
</ul>
<strong>WSU course codes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong><code>SUBJECT 1XX, 2XX, etc.</code></strong> – This code will appear when courses taken at the transfer institution transfer to WSU but do not have a direct equivalency to a WSU course. Example HIST 100 at the transfer institution may transfer to WSU as HISTORY 1XX. These courses may still satisfy UCORE requirements.</li>
	<li><strong><code>ELECTIVE 1XX, 2XX, etc.</code></strong> – This code appears for courses that do not have a direct equivalency but transfer to WSU for elective credit. The appropriate departments and colleges determine the use of elective credit toward degree requirements.</li>
	<li><strong><code>UCORE 1XX, 2XX, etc.</code></strong> – This code appears for some courses taken at the transfer institution that can be used towards fulfilling UCORE but do not have a direct equivalency to a WSU course.</li>
	<li><strong><code>NON_T.</code></strong> – Non-transferable credits are credits that will not transfer to WSU. These credits may include but are not limited to:
<ul>
	<li>Courses taken at colleges or universities that are not regionally accredited</li>

<p class="vpue-jump-back"><a href="#top">—Back to Top—</a></p>

</dd><dt id="series-of-courses"><strong>Series of Courses</strong></dt><dd>
<p class="oue-normal"><strong>Some courses taken at a transfer institution may not transfer to WSU as a direct equivalency unless a full series of courses is taken at the transfer institution.</strong> This is common for science and math courses. It is highly recommended transfer students complete the full series of courses at a single transfer institution.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>“One to one rules”</strong> are simple equivalencies which identify that one course is equivalent to the WSU course and the transfer GPA reflects each course individually. Please note: One course cannot have two equivalencies in MyWSU.</li>
	<li><strong>“Many to one rules”</strong> are used to combine two or more transfer courses as equivalent to one WSU course. In these cases the transfer grade for the WSU internal equivalent will reflect the grade the student earned in the second course.</li>
	<li><strong>“Many to many rules”</strong> are considered complex equivalencies and are used to define that two or more transfer courses are equivalent to two or more WSU courses. This means that we must specify fixed units for each internal equivalent, and that the transfer grade is identified by an incoming course. For example, if there are three incoming courses that equate to two WSU courses, the transfer grade for the WSU internal equivalent will reflect the grade the student earned in the second and third quarter of the three quarter series. If the lab and lecture components are identified as separate course numbers, the transfer grade(s) used will be based on the lecture portion(s) of the course(s), not the lab component.</li>
