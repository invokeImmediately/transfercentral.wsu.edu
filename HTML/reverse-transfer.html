    <h3 class="fancy with-top-border">Did You Transfer Before Earning an Associate Degree?</h3> 
    <p>Have you transferred to <a href="https://wsu.edu/" target="_blank">Washington State University</a> before earning your associate’s degree? Students transferring to Washington State University from a Washington community or technical college before earning an associate degree will be able to apply academic credits they earn at WSU to complete that degree. Adding an associate degree to your college transcript will help build your resume, document applicable job qualifications, and provide you with the benefits and options associated with earning an associate in arts degree as part of the Direct Transfer Agreement.</p>

<section id="qualifications">
    <h3 class="fancy with-top-border">Do You Qualify?</h3>
    <p>If you have earned at least 60 quarter credits or 40 semester credits of transferrable credit, you are eligible to earn an associate degree. You must be enrolled at WSU prior to earning an associate degree. Eligible WSU transfer students will be notified electronically at the end of their first semester at WSU about the opportunity to attain an associate degree by reporting credits back to their previous community or technical college through transcript document.</p>

    <p>“We want our students to be successful in their education, and a degree is a big part of showing their accomplishment. Granting students an associate degree even after they’ve transferred from a community or technical college helps build their resumes and puts them in a good position when they enter the job market,” said Marty Brown, SBCTC’s executive director.</p>
