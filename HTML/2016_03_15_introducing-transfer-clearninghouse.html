<h3>Introducing the Transfer Clearinghouse</h3>
<p class="article-media-contacts"><strong>Waylon Safranski, Assistant Director of the Transfer Resource Center, 509-335-8704, <a href="mailto:wski@wsu.edu?subject=RE: Introducing the Transfer Clearinghouse" target="_blank" title="Send an email to our Assistant Director">wski@wsu.edu</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>PULLMAN, Wash.—</strong>In addition to resources and services provided by Admission Counselors, WSU has recently created the Transfer Clearinghouse unit to provide transfer students with an additional point of contact throughout their transfer transition. </span>The Clearinghouse staff consists of Susan Poch, director and assistant vice provost, Waylon Safranski, assistant director, and Erica Stubbs, graduate assistant. Collectively they are committed to collaborating with the many transfer stakeholders to ensure transfer student success continues at WSU.</p><!--more-->
<p>“The ultimate goal is to boost the number of transfer students at WSU and improve their retention and graduation rates,” Poch said. “Transfer students bring diversity and unique experiences, and there will be more intentional focus on transfers in the years to come.”</p>
<p>One of the first steps in creating the Transfer Clearinghouse was to develop a dedicated email “answerline” (<a href="mailto:transfer@wsu.edu">transfer@wsu.edu</a>) to serve any and all transfer-related inquiries. A website (<a href="http://transfercredit.wsu.edu">transfercredit.wsu.edu</a>) has also been launched, and it details the transfer credit process, types of credit and how degrees transfer, evaluation requests and equivalency tools, academic programs and graduation requirements, statewide transfer initiatives, and WSU resources for transfer students. The Clearinghouse is also working on new technology to show prospective students how their transfer credit applies toward WSU degree requirements.</p>
<p>The Transfer Clearinghouse has focused on the articulation of credit as recent data showed around 80% of WSU graduates earned some type of transfer credit. A recent transfer credit initiative added WSU University Common Requirement (UCORE) equivalencies to 4,500 courses offered at Washington Community and Technical Colleges. The Clearinghouse offers prospective students unofficial credit evaluations which provides them with the earliest and fullest understanding of how credit will transfer and apply toward intended degree requirements. The Clearinghouse also serves as a point of contact for a Reverse Transfer Articulation Pilot Program with the State Board for Community &amp; Technical Colleges, which is designed to assist current WSU students with the process of earning their associate’s degree with WSU coursework.</p>
<p>Assisting transfer students throughout their time at WSU is another focus of the TCH, and WSU is working toward the creation of dedicated Transfer Centerspace and services on each campus. These centers will include transfer advising, access to campus-based services and resources, promotion of clubs and activities, and the potential for seminars and courses designed to integrate successful academic strategies for transfers. The TCH staff looks forward to hearing from you and your students, so please email <a href="mailto:transfer@wsu.edu">transfer@wsu.edu</a> and visit <a href="http://transfercredit.wsu.edu">transfercredit.wsu.edu</a> for more information.</p>
