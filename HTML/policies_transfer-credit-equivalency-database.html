<p><span class="accentuated-text">The <a href="https://zzusis-utilities.wsu.edu/psportal/pages/transfercoursesearch.html" target="_blank">Transfer Credit Equivalencies website</a> provides information to assist students in planning for transfer of courses to WSU.</span> Transfer courses are displayed when a direct equivalency at WSU exists, if a course is similar to a WSU University Common Requirement (UCORE), if the course is a department or general elective, or if the courses are non-transferable.</p>
<p>Information provided at this site should be used in conjunction with the <a href="http://catalog.wsu.edu" target="_blank">WSU Catalog</a> along with the catalog of the institution from which coursework is being transferred. This site does not certify applicability of transfer credit toward degree requirements.</p>
<p><em>Please note new and updated equivalencies are continuously being added and the information in this website is subject to change. Questions can be directed to <a href="mailto:transfer@wsu.edu">transfer@wsu.edu</a>.</em></p>
<h3 class="fancy with-top-border">How To Use the Database</h3>
<p>When selecting <a href="https://zzusis-utilities.wsu.edu/psportal/pages/transfercoursesearch.html" target="_blank">Transfer Course Search</a>, you will enter search criteria including state, transfer institution, WSU expected entry term, and subject.  This will display information regarding the transfer courses within that course subject including the course numbers found in the transfer course database. You can search for all courses at an institution by selecting country or state and institution and leave the subject area blank. All columns are sortable except for UCORE, but you can use Control-F to find specific UCORE categories.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://zzusis-utilities.wsu.edu/psportal/pages/transfercoursesearch.html" target="_blank">Browse Transfer Course Information</a> selection is used if you know the WSU course you are searching for.  The Transfer Course Search selection is used if you know the transfer course and wish to view the WSU course equivalency.</p>
<h4>Date Ranges</h4>
<p>If you see an ending Date Range of 12/31/9999 it means that the course equivalency has been extended indefinitely and will be adjusted when either the WSU course or the transfer course equivalency changes. This end date will primarily appear for transfer courses that have recently been reviewed for UCORE, most Common Course Numbers, general electives, and non-transferable courses.</p>
<p>If you see an equivalency with a date range that is in the past, the equivalency listed has been approved for this date range only. Reviews of courses with outdated date ranges can be requested by emailing <a href="mailto:transfer@wsu.edu">transfer@wsu.edu</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Lab Credit</strong><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/917/2015/07/Lab-Credit-example.png"><img class="autoScaled shiftToCenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/917/2015/07/Lab-Credit-example.png" alt="Lab Credit example" /></a></p>
<h4>Transfer Equivalency Examples</h4>
<p>"One to one rules" are simple equivalencies which identify that one course is equivalent to the WSU course and the transfer GPA reflects each course individually.  <em>Please note: </em>One course cannot have two equivalencies in MyWSU.</p>
<p>"Many to one rules" are used to combine two or more transfer courses as equivalent to one WSU course. In these cases the transfer grade for the WSU internal equivalent will reflect the grade the student earned in the second course.</p>
<p>"Many to many rules" are considered complex equivalencies and are used to define that two or more transfer courses are equivalent to two or more WSU courses.  This means that we must specify fixed units for each internal equivalent, and that the transfer grade is identified by an incoming course.  For example, if there are three incoming courses that equate to two WSU courses, the transfer grade for the WSU internal equivalent will reflect the grade the student earned in the second and third quarter of the three quarter series.  If the lab and lecture components are identified as separate course numbers, the transfer grade(s) used will be based on the lecture portion(s) of the course(s), not the lab component.</p>
<p><em>Please note:</em> It is highly recommended transfer students complete the full series of courses at a single transfer institution as courses cannot be combined from multiple transfer institutions.<a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/917/2015/07/Series-of-courses.png"><img class="autoScaled shiftToCenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/917/2015/07/Series-of-courses.png" alt="Series of courses" /></a></p>
