    <dt><strong>How do I request UCORE equivalencies?</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Send an email to <a href="mailto:transfer@wsu.edu" target="_blank">transfer@wsu.edu</a> with a course description, syllabus (if available), and what UCORE equivalency you are requesting. Evaluators will review that information along with the general education distribution list of the transfer institution to determine any UCORE equivalency. If the re-evaluation of the course does not yield UCORE equivalency, work with an academic advisor to submit the <a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/917/2015/08/Transfer-Subsitution-Requests-Rev-3-15.pdf" target="_blank" title="">Transfer Course Substitution Form</a> to the Undergraduate Education Petition Committee.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>How do I request departmental equivalencies?</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Please connect with the Transfer Clearinghouse at <a href="mailto:transfer@wsu.edu" target="_blank">transfer@wsu.edu</a> and submit a course description and syllabus (if available), and we will contact of the appropriate WSU College. If the department determines an equivalency, they need to email <a href="mailto:transfer@wsu.edu" target="_blank">transfer@wsu.edu</a> so the transfer credit equivalency tables can be updated for future evaluations of the course. If new information is available after a student’s initial TCR was created a request for an updated evaluation review can be sent to transfer@wsu.edu.</p>
        <p><em>Please Note:</em> Changing the transfer credit equivalencies tables does not change a Transfer Credit Report that was completed prior to the updated equivalency — a request has to be made for each update.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>What do I need to request an update to a transfer credit report?</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Situations where you will need to request an update to a transfer credit report include, but are not limited to, the following:
        <ul>
            <li>An external degree, such as an Associate of Arts-DTA, is on an official transcript but not posted on the TCR.</p></li>
            <li>A transfer course is missing on the TCR or is not accurately transcribed.</li>
            <li>A new equivalency has been created.</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>What do I do when encounter a course not listed on the transfer credit equivalencies website or with an expired end date?</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Please email course description information to <a href="mailto:transfer@wsu.edu" target="_blank">transfer@wsu.edu</a> for review. If the department determines an updated equivalency, they need to email <a href="mailto:transfer@wsu.edu" target="_blank">transfer@wsu.edu</a> so the transfer credit equivalency tables can be updated for future evaluations of the course. <em>Please Note:</em> Pre-evaluation of courses not listed on the transfer credit equivalency website cannot be guaranteed for students who have not yet applied to WSU.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>What types of coursework result in non-transferable credits?</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Transfer credit is not normally awarded for the following types of study or coursework:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Courses taken at colleges or universities that are not regionally accredited.</li>
            <li>Non-credit courses and workshops.</li>
            <li>Remedial or college preparatory courses.</li>
            <li>Sectarian religious studies.</li>
            <li>Vocational-technical courses.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The ICRC handbook also has guidelines for Washington Community & Technical College <a href="http://www.washingtoncouncil.org/ICRC%20Documents/THE%20ICRC%20HANDBOOK%20%202004%20%20Updated%20June%2010%202015%20final.pdf" target="_blank" title="">Restricted Subject Areas on pg. 28-31</a>.</p>
        <p>Requests for review of non-transferable coursework can be sent to <a href="mailto:transfer@wsu.edu" target="_blank">transfer@wsu.edu</a>.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>How should institutions with national accreditation be handled?</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Students who have taken college-level, academic work at institutions that are not regionally accredited but are nationally accredited may petition for transfer of appropriate credits. Petitions may be filed after the student has completed a minimum of one semester (minimum of 15 credits) of satisfactory work at WSU. Please see <a href="http://catalog.wsu.edu/General/AcademicRegulations/ListBy/14" target="_blank">Academic Regulation 14 for full details</a>.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>How are applications to graduate handled for former students?</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>If students do not need to enroll in WSU courses and only wish to apply to graduate, please have them contact <a href="mailto:wsu.graduations@wsu.edu" target="_blank">wsu.graduations@wsu.edu</a>. <em>Please Note:</em> WSU will only articulate transfer credit for students who have applied to graduate from WSU and enrolled students.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>What is the academic forgiveness policy for transfer applicants?</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>If you are evaluating admission credentials of students with transfer work whose cumulative transfer grade point average is below a 2.00, then you may disregard all of the post-secondary transfer credit from a previous institution, provided that the work was completed not less than four years before the time of enrollment at WSU. Please see <a href="http://catalog.wsu.edu/General/AcademicRegulations/ListBy/4" target="_blank">Academic Regulation 4(d)</a> for full details.</p>
