            <li>WSU uses the American Council on Education (ACE) "A Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services" as a framework for evaluating transferable credit documented on military transcripts.</li>
            <li>ACE recommendations for the amount and level of credit (upper or lower division) are followed if the military course is applicable to university or departmental regulations.</li></ol></li>
        <li>DANTES Credit: Credit for DANTES Subject Standardized Tests (DSSTs) will be granted for college-level academic subjects (non-vocational/technical courses) using the minimum score and credit amount recommendations of the American Council on Education.</li>

    <p>At WSU, we use the following procedures to ensure every veteran receives the maximum amount of college credit for military training possible.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>WSU evaluates every military transcript received from active duty military and veterans pursuing an education here.</li>
        <li>WSU uses the American Council on Education (ACE) "A Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services" as a guide. ACE translates military courses and occupations into academic credit recommendations, and provides guidelines to interpret and recommend credit for college courses.</li>
        <li>ACE recommendations for the amount and level of credit (upper or lower division) are followed if the military course is applicable to university or departmental regulations.</li>
        <li>ACE credits on transcripts that do not match any courses in any degree of pursuit may be accepted as elective credits if applicable to the student’s degree program.</li>
        <li>Lower-division transfer credit is limited to 73 credits from all sources (transfer, credit by exam, military, other). Total transferable credit is limited to 90 credits.</li>

    <p>The Joint Services Transcript for Army, Coast Guard, Marine Corps, and Navy active duty, reserve, and veterans can be requested at <a href="https://jst.doded.mil/smart/signIn.do" target="_blank">jst.doded.mil/smart</a>.</p>
